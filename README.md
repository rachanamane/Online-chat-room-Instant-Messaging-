# Online-chat-room-Instant-Messaging-

Instant messaging (IM) is a type of online chat which offers real-time text transmission over the Internet. Usually it is based on C/S architecture which means it has a client and a server. The client contacts the server to create account, get online users, send and receive messages. The objective of the project is to develop a multi-threaded server for an online chat room. At the end of the course, your server will be able to handle multiple clients simultaneously.

The project will be divided into three parts. In exercise 1, a thread pool is implemented to perform concurrent tasks. In the second exercise, multi-threaded server  is implemented using the thread pool which was created in exercise 1. In the last exercise, encryption is added to the communications between server and clients.
